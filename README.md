## Description 

This project was assigned to me to create a weather dashboard to help with planning potential vacation destinations. This will show the current weather status as well as a future 5 day forecast. I was unable to successfully generate an API call, regardless of the assistance I was offered.

## Learning Points 

Throughout the development of this program I was able to develop my JavaScript, JQuery and API abilities, as well as continuing to work on my HTML and CSS. I was able to utilize different skills such as creating arrays, developing variables using the API methods, appending information to the DOM, continuing to grow my JavaScript function skills and linking ot external API.
